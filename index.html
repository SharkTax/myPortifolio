                <h3>who is me?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello wolrd, i am victor maciel, and here i want to speak about me and my journey into <span>programming</span> <br>
                    I`ve been studying progamming for <span>2 years</span>. First i started when i was with free time in my house, just for curiosity.
                    My first project was in <span>HTML, Css and javaScipt</span>, wich you can see at my <a href="https://github.com/SharkTax">gitHub</a>.
                    <br>
                    since then i`ve been developing my skils in backend, and improving my logic. Today i know python, javaScript, and sql
                    
                <h3>what am I capable of doing</h3>
                    
                    Since i`m in college, e got even better solving problems. Some of my teatchers gives me situations where i have to do a solution with c++ or python
                    , with this exercises, i noticed i`m very good developing projects that works. Not just this but i can make sites too, and work with SQL.

                <h3>where do i want to arrive?</h3>
                    For now i want i just want to enter in the area, and develop my self professionaly working with professionals in the area.
                    For the future, i hope with my knolege and years of experience, i want to be in a big company, and developing my own project, for the people see
